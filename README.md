# TooLowForComfort Website

http://too-low-for-comfort.herokuapp.com/toolow

This website is for car enthusiasts that showcases their cars and posts them on a blog. The user has to create an account on the website and can only edit & delete their own posts. On the home page, it shows the TooLowForComfort shop with some of the merch. Unfortunately it is all currently sold out, but will restock in the future.

I used mongodb Atlas as my database to store my posts and heroku to host my project. Also used express and mongoose to make a full CRUD app. And lastly used css to style the website.

In the future I would like to add a comment section on each post for users to be able to comment on other user's posts.
